    <p>My prices are on the menu, but they vary. </p>
    <p>Right now I only accept venmo in US dollars. For more information check my TOS.</p>
   
    <p><span class="w3-tag">VARY RANGE!</span> When you ask for a commission for Characters, the prices vary and include up to +$3 depending on the complexity. </p>
    <p><strong>Complexity accounts</strong> Certain designs, requested gradients, extra requested features like shine or shadow, etc.</p>
    <p>Use this list to decide if your request will change your price.</p>
   <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48 w3-hover-grey"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">TIMING</span></h5>
   <p> My art work takes a bit to draw, and coloring takes around one or two hours, so I add that time estimate on to my main drawing time. A headshot colored will take around three hours to complete, and a full body colored will take around five or six for perfection...</p> 
  <p>I need you to understand it is my time I am using to give you the art you want, so I may have it vary depending on my personal life and other events. I also need you to understand this is not my main job, and I have relationships (smirks) and other important things that are more important than commissions. I will put as much time as I can for your art, and your art is the most important thing on my agenda when in work. I will put aside small things like going hanging with friends often to only when I have time. Thanks for understanding the time policy.
